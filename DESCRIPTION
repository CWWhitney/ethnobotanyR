Package: ethnobotanyR
Type: Package
Title: Ethnobotanical Analysis, Decision-Framing, and TEK Modeling
Description: Tools for quantifying Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), modeling TEK in decision frameworks, and designing structured decision-framing exercises in conservation and development contexts. The package implements quantitative ethnobotany indices (Use Value, Relative Frequency of Citation, etc.) but positions them within a larger framework of Bayesian modeling and participatory decision analysis. Includes critical assessment of indices' limitations and case studies of participatory workshops.
