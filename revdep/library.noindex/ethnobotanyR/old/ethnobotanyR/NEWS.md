ethnobotanyR 0.1.4 is a patch:

The `Radial_plot()` function is now added and can offer a quick descriptive overview of the results of different indices per species. 

The `FLs()` function is now included to calculate the fidelity level (FL) of species uses in ethnobotany studies. 

Plots made with `ethnoChord()` and `ethnoChordUser()`  are more orderly now that the informants and species lists are arranged.
