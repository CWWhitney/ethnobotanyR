Hard Questions About the Core Idea of using Benin case as a method description

## Decision Quality Framework Mismatch

Howard's decision quality was designed for corporate/organizational contexts with relatively clear payoffs and stakeholders who accept technical frameworks.
Conservation + development decisions are politically contested—they're not primarily technical problems needing better framing. Framing itself is the power struggle.
Risk: you're taking a mechanistic framework and applying it to genuinely messy, value-laden problems where "framing" often masks whose interests win.

## The Participatory Knowledge Integration Problem

The gap between "gathering participatory input" and "actually integrating TEK into decisions" is enormous and glossed over in most frameworks.
Real integration would mean: communities define the decision, not researchers/NGOs applying a framework to pre-selected decisions.

Risk: you end up instrumentalizing TEK—treating it as data input rather than recognizing incommensurable decision-making systems.
Who decides what counts as "expert knowledge"? That's already a framing that privileges some voices.

## Nutrition/Development as Proxy Outcomes

Nutrition and "development outcomes" are often what outsiders think matters, not what communities prioritize (livelihood security, cultural continuity, autonomy, dignity often rank higher).
Focusing decision-framing on nutrition/development outcomes risks reproducing the same extractive logic you're trying to move beyond.
Specific Critique of Using Benin Workshop as Methodology Template
This is where I'd be most critical:

## One Workshop is Not a Methodology

A workshop output is a bounded event, not evidence of a replicable process.
Critical missing information: What actually happened after the workshop? Did those framings persist? Did they change? What did participants actually do with them?
You're teaching people a method based on a single successful instance—no variation, failure modes, or boundary conditions.

## Context-Specificity Collapse

Benin's legal framework, market systems, ethnic diversity, colonial history, current governance capacity, and ecological context are specific to Benin.
Presenting it as a general example obscures which elements are transferable and which aren't.
Risk: readers apply Benin logic to contexts where it's inappropriate (e.g., contexts with more aggressive outsider pressure, weaker local institutions, different power dynamics with government).

## The Representation Problem

Who were the workshop participants? Were they actually decision-makers or selected elites?
Did the "framing process" reflect actual power, or did it reflect who showed up and could speak in a workshop?
Publishing a Benin case as exemplary without naming power imbalances risks neo-colonial framing: the African case as instructive example for others.

## The Method/Illustration Confusion

If the goal is to teach a process (pre-framing, framing, participatory input gathering), a case study is a weak pedagogical tool.
Better: make the process explicit first (e.g., step-by-step protocol, decision trees about when to use what), then illustrate with Benin and other cases.
Right now, Benin appears to be modeling something universal, but it's actually only showing a context-specific outcome.
Deeper Structural Critiques

## Missing Conflict and Failure

What happens when stakeholders disagree fundamentally? Howard's framework doesn't handle genuine value incommensurability well.
When do these pre-framing processes fail? Which conditions make them inappropriate?
What's the power dynamics story? (Often absent from "participatory" literature.)

## Accountability Beyond the Workshop

Decision-framing exercises often produce beautiful consensus in the room that evaporates when people face real constraints (poverty, market prices, government policies, ecological surprises).
You'd need longitudinal evidence: did the framed decisions actually get made? Did they improve outcomes? For whom?

## Ethnobotany-Ethnoecology Integration is Underspecified

How does TEK about plant uses (ethnobotany) actually change conservation or nutrition decisions?
The link between "farmers know which species are nutritious and resilient" → "better decisions" requires lots of institutional/market/policy scaffolding that often isn't there.
Risk: treating TEK as a dataset that improves decision-making when the real constraint is access, tenure, markets, or political will.

## Suggested Changes

Start with an explicit framework grounded in decision theory + participatory ethics + ethnobotany literature.

What are the principles of good decision-framing in conservation/development contexts with indigenous/local communities?
Under what conditions does pre-framing help vs. obscure?
Use Benin as one case among several—and be clear about what it shows and doesn't show.

Include cases where the process failed or only partially worked.
Compare across contexts to extract principles, not present Benin as the model.
Be radically honest about limitations:

Decision-framing doesn't solve structural problems (poverty, weak institutions, climate shocks, global markets).
Participatory processes can legitimize external agendas if power imbalances aren't actively addressed.
TEK is valuable but isn't automatically better for conservation outcomes—context matters enormously.
Name the epistemological and political questions explicitly:

Are you asking communities to adopt outsiders' decision frameworks?
Or are you supporting communities' own decision processes?
These are different, and the choice itself is a framing.
Bottom line: The idea has merit, but the current approach risks replicating standard participatory development rhetoric without genuinely grappling with power, context-specificity, and the limits of technical framing for political problems. A single workshop case, however successful, isn't a methodology—it's an anecdote dressed up as methods.
