	title = {African baobab trees (\textit{{Adansonia} digitata} {L}.) recorded in {Uganda}},
	abstract = {The baobab (Adansonia digitata L.) is a key tree species of economic and cultural importance in many African countries. International interest in the species has intensified in recent years, following the acceptance of baobab fruit pulp as a food ingredient by the European Union and the US Food and Drug Administration. The tree is widely known to be absent in Uganda despite its wide distribution in most neighboring East African countries. Not only is the baobab regarded as absent in natural habitats, it is also not known to be cultivated on farmland or in homegardens in Uganda. Research trips to the Central, Western, Eastern and Northern Regions of Uganda were conducted in 2015 and 2016 within the collaborative research project “Reduction of Post-Harvest Losses and Value Addition in East African Food Value Chains” (RELOAD). Assessment of cultivated plant species was made through homegarden and field visits and through interviews with farmers. The objective was to study plant species diversity and its importance for conservation, and for regional livelihoods and nutrition. As a result of our expeditions, four vigorous baobab trees were identified in the Eastern Region of Uganda aged between nine and 22 years, and one was found in the Central region with an unknown age. Two baobab trees were located in a courtyard to the northeast of Soroti town in the Soroti District, two were recorded in a traditional homegarden southwest of Busembatia town in the Iganga District, and one baobab was found in an urban garden in Kampala. Planting materials for the Eastern region baobabs originated in Sudan and Kenya. To our knowledge, these are the first scientific records of the African baobab in Uganda and some research questions can be formulated based on this discovery: How will these baobab trees perform in the future? When will they start to flower and fruit? What fruit quality can be expected and will local people accept it as food? Will this tree species become a common plant of homegardens in the Eastern Region of Uganda? Are there more unknown baobabs in homegardens, on farm-land and/or in the wild of Uganda?},

Data from 24-hour diet recalls (55\% in the wet season) of n = 6,226 participants (34\% women) in rural areas from seven low- and middle-income countries were analyzed. Mean adequacies of vitamin A, vitamin C, folate, calcium, iron, and zinc and diet diversity score (DDS) were used to assess diet quality. Associations of biodiversity indicators with nutrient adequacy were quantified using multilevel models, receiver operating characteristic curves, and test sensitivity and specificity. A total of 234 different species were consumed, of which {\textless}30\% were consumed in more than one country. Nine species were consumed in all countries and provided, on average, 61\% of total energy intake and a significant contribution of micronutrients in the wet season. Compared with Simpson's index of diversity and functional diversity, species richness (SR) showed stronger associations and better diagnostic properties with micronutrient adequacy. For every additional species consumed, dietary nutrient adequacy increased by 0.03 (P {\textless} 0.001). Diets with higher nutrient adequacy were mostly obtained when both SR and DDS were maximal. Adding SR to the minimum cutoff for minimum diet diversity improved the ability to detect diets with higher micronutrient adequacy in women but not in children.

	volume = {14},
	abstract = {Trees and shrubs are disappearing fast in anthropogenic landscapes of Uganda. In order to promote their conservation on-farm, there is need to involve farmers. Farmers’ involvement in tree/shrub management requires a clear understanding of the households’ needs that trees can satisfy, the priority species to satisfy these needs, as well as tree management practices and challenges that hinder tree planting. This study was carried out to satisfy these information needs and to also determine species that are locally threatened. The study was conducted in selected villages of Arua and Kiruhura districts between June and October 2012 using an ethnobotanical approach. Our results indicate that farmers value tree products to satisfy household welfare needs of accessing food (edible fruits), generating income, and accessing construction wood. The species are multi-purpose, and the most preferred are Eucalyptus spp., Mangifera indica L., Persea americana Mill., Carica papaya L., Citrus limon (L.) Osbeck, Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam., Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck, Annona senegalensis Pers., Pinus spp., and Tectona grandis L.f. Most farmers maintain trees on their land in courtyards, backyard gardens, or crop fields and ranches. Tree species are threatened by destructive harvesting and clearing land for agriculture. The key challenges to intensification of tree cultivation are livestock damage, land shortage, drought, and lack of financial resources. Farmers suggested that in order to strengthen tree planting, they should be provided with inputs including seedlings, chemicals, and tools. In conclusion farmers prefer exotic tree species to satisfy household needs. Intensification of tree management will need to address a number of challenges identified in this study.},

	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE:  We introduce and explain the advantages of the Bayesian approach and exemplify the method with an analysis of the medicinal flora of Campania, Italy. The Bayesian approach is a new method, which allows to compare medicinal floras with the overall flora of a given area and to investigate over- and underused plant families. In contrast to previously used methods (regression analysis and binomial method) it considers the inherent uncertainty around the analyzed data. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The medicinal flora with 423 species was compiled based on nine studies on local medicinal plant use in Campania. The total flora comprises 2237 species belonging to 128 families. Statistical analysis was performed with the Bayesian method and the binomial method. An approximated χ(2)-test was used to analyze the relationship between use categories and higher taxonomic groups. RESULTS:  Among the larger plant families we find the Lamiaceae, Rosaceae, and Malvaceae, to be overused in the local medicine of Campania and the Orchidaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Poaceae, and Fabaceae to be underused compared to the overall flora. Furthermore, do specific medicinal uses tend to be correlated with taxonomic plant groups. For example, are the Monocots heavily used for urological complaints. CONCLUSIONS:  Testing for over- and underused taxonomic groups of a flora with the Bayesian method is easy to adopt and can readily be calculated in excel spreadsheets using the excel function Inverse beta (INV.BETA). In contrast to the binomial method the presented method is also suitable for small datasets. With larger datasets the two methods tend to converge. However, results are generally more conservative with the Bayesian method pointing out fewer families as over- or underused.},

Various factors influence the agrobiodiversity of these homegardens and consequently the health of the households that keep them. Homegardens in southwestern Uganda (n=102) contained over 200 crops. Significant socio-economic and biophysical predictors of crop diversity included elevation, location, garden size, distance to market and livestock ownership. Elevation, location and garden size also differed between four garden types, identified by cluster analysis (‘diverse tree gardens’, ‘small forest-edge gardens’, ‘large, old, species-rich gardens’, and ‘large, annual-dominated herb gardens’). Quantitative ethnobotany indices confirmed that crops were mainly useful for food, economy and medicine. Comparison of agrobiodiversity data with multiple- pass 24-hour recalls, anthropometric measurements and food insecurity questionnaires (n=589, 325 and 95 respectively) indicated positive relationships between agrobiodiversity and health outcomes. Forecasts of the nutrition implications of agricultural development-decisions revealed the importance of homegardens for addressing hidden hunger and food insecurity.},

The aim was to determine the extent, composition and function of uses of native species of terrestrial plants, algae and fungi in the region through the use of quantitative ethnobotanical methodology. By identifying culturally significant native species of terrestrial plants, algae and fungi, researchers in the study hope to show that the potential for conservation also increases.
The survey identified a total of 130 native species with cultural significance from 88 genera, including 99 native species of terrestrial plants (65 species of annual, eight species of perennial herbs, 15 species of perennial shrubs and 11 species of perennial trees), 20 native species of algae, 10 native species of fungi, and one native species of lichen. In Iceland 109 native species were cited as culturally significant (CI (index)), whereas 57 were identified in the Faroe Islands. All respondents collected some wild species and 50 percent grew some native species in home gardens or commercially. 
The proportion of all potentially usable native species with CI in the Faroe Islands and Iceland however could be much greater. Nevertheless, some native species of plants are known ubiquitously. The most commonly used are the Angelica spp. and Betula spp., traditionally used for food and medicine and still used today for these purposes. A strong possibility for sustainable management of wild collection of these native species exists through expansion of organic certification. 
The identification of cultural keystone species is hence paramount in their conservation. Looking at ways to increase the cultural importance and the number and types of uses by people living in an area will increase the likelihood that the natural areas where these species exist will be preserved. Culture and knowledge are dynamic, and this survey attempts to look at cultural uses of native plants while being mindful of the dynamism of cultural knowledge and the changes that are taking place to both ecology and culture. 
Through the interviews and sample collections, it became apparent that there exists a conservation mentality in the culture of native plant collection and usage in the Faroe Islands and Iceland. People who tend to use native biodiversity also tend to have an appreciation and a conservation attitude toward that biodiversity. Many of the wild collectors are also activists and politically active change agents in the Icelandic and Faroese politics related to natural resources management. 
A chef in Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands said that wild collection by his kitchen staff and others around Scandinavia is leading to a new paradigm of food in the North Atlantic. The movement is called the Nordic Kitchen and is leading to conservation efforts by chefs and food enthusiasts around the region to learn, preserve, and utilize native species for traditional and innovative local meals.},

Data is based on inventories of 102 homegardens in the Greater Bushenyi from 2014 and reveals 225 useful plant species in 14 different use categories with 3,961 UR, 54\% for food, 15\% for economic uses, and 11\% for medicine.

	title = {Value of plants in {Ugandan} homegardens; results of homegardens inventories and participatory ethnobotany investigations},
	abstract = {Introduction: Homegardens are complex and small scale traditional farming systems, predominantly in the humid tropics, characterized as intimate multi‐story gardens around homesteads, designed to meet household consumption needs and produce for markets. They are diverse agroforestry systems containing a variety of crops and indigenous plants with an associated diversity of traditional knowledge. Little is known about this diversity in the highland homegardens of the Ugandan Southwest. The study described aimed to bridge this gap. Agriculture is the main economic activity in the region, mainly small‐scale producers engaged in a wide range of crops and other commodities, notably production of Matooke Musa acuminata Colla (AAA‐EA). Homegardens in the region are dominated by bananas and intercropped with coffee, staples, fruits, vegetables, medicinal plants, and trees for fuel wood with few small livestock. Methods: The work described is based on interviews and homegarden inventories with 102 farmers in the Greater Bushenyi region in 2014 and 2015. Categorization of plants into different uses by farmers was done using the quantitative ethnobotany indices including, most importantly, the use report (UR), which occurs when a species is mentioned or observed being used for a certain defined use‐category and the cultural importance index, or UR divided by N. Agro‐ecological importance is here measured with the Summed Dominance Ration (SDR). Results: The 31 plants with a Ci index score above 0.5 included 8 annuals and 13 perennials, 1 liane climber, 3 shrubs, and 6 trees. {\textgreater}60\% were used for food, {\textgreater}15\% for sale, {\textgreater}2\% for hygiene, {\textgreater}1\% for technical uses, other use categories were less than 1\% of UR. Correlation tests of ecological and ethnobotany scores indicated that those plants with the highest Ci index scores were among those with the greatest SDR (p{\textless}0.05) and importance to the diversity of the homegardens.

	doi = {10.1007/s10745-012-9517-0},
	abstract = {Hotspots of bio and cultural diversity have been and continue to be the focus of conservation efforts and ethnobotany explorations worldwide (Hoffman and Gallaher 2007) as they harbor such a great number of species and ethnicities. However, the loss of native species and habitats is also taking place in “cold spots” with low bio (Kassam 2008) and cultural diversity such as Iceland. This study is based on surveys with a select group of Icelandic people who utilize native species of plants as well as fungi and marine algae (e.g., chefs, farmers, gardeners and herbalists). It covers the use of native and naturalized introduced species and uses the terms, materials, and methods of ethnobotany to document, describe and explain these uses (Alexiades 1996). Ethnobotany’s rich and rigorous history, diverse and growing methodologies (Albuquerque and Hanazaki 2009) and potential for deepening the understanding of relationships between people and biota (Martin 1995; Balée and Brown 1996) make it a particularly useful tool for an exploration of the human uses of plants, as well as algae and fungi in Iceland. 
Icelanders live in a fragile ecosystem still disturbed by a settlement period (landnám) which took place over 1,000 years ago. Most inhabitants are still almost entirely dependent on goods transported from the mainland (Gun- narsson 1983). Throughout the natural history of Iceland which is documented in the sagas Íslendingabókar and Landnámabók (Benediktsson 1968) and in archeological records, represented at the Reykholt settlement in Borgarf- jördur (Buckland et al. 1992; Sveinbjarnardottir et al. 2007) and at a feasting hall in Hofstaðir (Lucas 2010) Icelanders have had a challenging relationship with their surrounding natural resources. Forest resources were an essential part of life at landnám: Firewood provided light, warmth, and the ability to cook and do metal work (Simpson et al. 2003). During landnám, Vikings cut many of the forests and sub- sequent regeneration was largely impossible due to the rooting and grazing of livestock (Hallsdóttir 1987; Eysteins- son and Blöndal 2003). This process of land-use change from forests to grazing lands has continued since landnám and, in many cases, has lead to serious soil degradation (Erlendsson et al. 2009). Iceland has seen a loss of over 40 \% of the soil present since landnám (Arnalds et al. 1987; Dugmore and Erskine 1994), and erosion is still among the top conservation issues in the country (Arnalds and Barkarson 2003). Of particular concern is the contribution of soil loss to the spreading of black basalt deserts (Arnalds et al. 2000). However, some conservation minded Icelanders are seeking new strategies for a more sustainable relationship with their environment through the use of native plants as well as algae and fungi for things such as food and medicine.},

It was found that some of the species (e.g. Angelica spp. and Betula spp.) were very important. However, potential exists for a more diverse harvest and for sustainable management (e.g. Organic certification). It was also found that potential exists for the spreading of knowledge and the inherent associated conservation culture of native species use. The data also suggests that cultural conservation should focus on food, which appears to be paramount for increasing the cultural importance of a species.},

	title = {Bayesian {Networks} for impact modeling of development interventions},
	abstract = {Agricultural systems are influenced by many economic and socio-political factors. Decision-makers selecting among management options struggle with this complexity, because it normally cannot be adequately described by classical data-driven models, at least not within the budget and time constraints of particular decisions. The holistic approach of decision-modeling with Bayesian Networks (BNs) may offer a solution. By explicitly considering uncertainty and updating prior probabilities, BNs can incorporate various sources of information, including expert judgment on the complex interactions of ecological, socioeconomic, cultural and political factors. BNs can produce probabilistic outcome projections for particular interventions and thereby supply decision-makers with robust science-based support for decisions. Here we use two case studies to show the use of BNs for agricultural development decisions. BNs were developed to describe the probable nutritional status of households over the course of a year under different agricultural development decisions with a focus on horticultural systems and botanical resources. The first study concerned Kenyan farming households and their decision to plant, or not to plant, fruit plants of Carica papaya L., Mangifera indica L., Passiflora edulis Sims. and Persea americana Mill. The second BN describes the impact pathway for transitioning from small-scale farming systems to industrial-scale agriculture proposed in Uganda’s National development plan. At the heart of the process is a participatory workshop, which is convened before any other analysis begins. Workshops sought to develop a decision-centered model based on the knowledge of a wide range of local experts. Participants were trained to estimate their own state of uncertainty and thereby reduce errors of judgment, under-confidence or overconfidence In order to facilitate the most accurate BN structures and variable estimates. Input variables were identified and their values quantified as probability distributions that describe participants’ current state of uncertainty. BNs show a high probability that the nutritional status of households will be positively impacted by planting fruit trees in Kenya and negatively through agricultural development in Uganda. This approach shows how using expert knowledge in participatory BNs can generate plausible household nutrition outcomes of agricultural development decisions. The methodology can be expanded to inform more of these difficult decisions.},

All identiﬁable causal eﬀects can be derived using the rules of do-calculus, but the rules themselves do not give any direct indication whether the eﬀect in question is identiﬁable or not. Shpitser and Pearl (2006b) constructed an algorithm for identifying joint interventional distributions in causal models, which contain unobserved variables and induce directed acyclic graphs. This algorithm can be seen as a repeated application of the rules of do-calculus and known properties of probabilities, and it ultimately either derives an expression for the causal distribution, or fails to identify the eﬀect, in which case the eﬀect is non-identiﬁable. In this paper, the R package causaleﬀect is presented, which provides an implementation of this algorithm. Functionality of causaleﬀect is also demonstrated through examples.},

In particular, ethnobiological investigations have found evidence and tested hypotheses over the last 30 years on the interactions between human groups and their environments, generating the need to formulate a theory for such systems. In this article, we propose the social-ecological theory of maximization to explain the construction and functioning of these systems over time, encompassing hypotheses and evidence from previous ethnobiological studies. In proposing the theory, we present definitions and two conceptual models, an environmental maximization model and a redundancy generation model. The first model seeks to address biota selection and its use by human populations. The second emphasizes how the system organizes itself from the elements that were incorporated into it. Furthermore, we provide the theoretical scenario of plant selection and use from an evolutionary perspective, which explicitly integrates the phylogenetic relationships of plants (or other living resources) and human beings.},
