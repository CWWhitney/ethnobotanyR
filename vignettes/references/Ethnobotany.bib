	volume = {14},
	abstract = {Trees and shrubs are disappearing fast in anthropogenic landscapes of Uganda. In order to promote their conservation on-farm, there is need to involve farmers. Farmers’ involvement in tree/shrub management requires a clear understanding of the households’ needs that trees can satisfy, the priority species to satisfy these needs, as well as tree management practices and challenges that hinder tree planting. This study was carried out to satisfy these information needs and to also determine species that are locally threatened. The study was conducted in selected villages of Arua and Kiruhura districts between June and October 2012 using an ethnobotanical approach. Our results indicate that farmers value tree products to satisfy household welfare needs of accessing food (edible fruits), generating income, and accessing construction wood. The species are multi-purpose, and the most preferred are Eucalyptus spp., Mangifera indica L., Persea americana Mill., Carica papaya L., Citrus limon (L.) Osbeck, Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam., Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck, Annona senegalensis Pers., Pinus spp., and Tectona grandis L.f. Most farmers maintain trees on their land in courtyards, backyard gardens, or crop fields and ranches. Tree species are threatened by destructive harvesting and clearing land for agriculture. The key challenges to intensification of tree cultivation are livestock damage, land shortage, drought, and lack of financial resources. Farmers suggested that in order to strengthen tree planting, they should be provided with inputs including seedlings, chemicals, and tools. In conclusion farmers prefer exotic tree species to satisfy household needs. Intensification of tree management will need to address a number of challenges identified in this study.},

	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE:  We introduce and explain the advantages of the Bayesian approach and exemplify the method with an analysis of the medicinal flora of Campania, Italy. The Bayesian approach is a new method, which allows to compare medicinal floras with the overall flora of a given area and to investigate over- and underused plant families. In contrast to previously used methods (regression analysis and binomial method) it considers the inherent uncertainty around the analyzed data. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The medicinal flora with 423 species was compiled based on nine studies on local medicinal plant use in Campania. The total flora comprises 2237 species belonging to 128 families. Statistical analysis was performed with the Bayesian method and the binomial method. An approximated χ(2)-test was used to analyze the relationship between use categories and higher taxonomic groups. RESULTS:  Among the larger plant families we find the Lamiaceae, Rosaceae, and Malvaceae, to be overused in the local medicine of Campania and the Orchidaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Poaceae, and Fabaceae to be underused compared to the overall flora. Furthermore, do specific medicinal uses tend to be correlated with taxonomic plant groups. For example, are the Monocots heavily used for urological complaints. CONCLUSIONS:  Testing for over- and underused taxonomic groups of a flora with the Bayesian method is easy to adopt and can readily be calculated in excel spreadsheets using the excel function Inverse beta (INV.BETA). In contrast to the binomial method the presented method is also suitable for small datasets. With larger datasets the two methods tend to converge. However, results are generally more conservative with the Bayesian method pointing out fewer families as over- or underused.},

	title = {Bayesian {Networks} for impact modeling of development interventions},
	abstract = {Agricultural systems are influenced by many economic and socio-political factors. Decision-makers selecting among management options struggle with this complexity, because it normally cannot be adequately described by classical data-driven models, at least not within the budget and time constraints of particular decisions. The holistic approach of decision-modeling with Bayesian Networks (BNs) may offer a solution. By explicitly considering uncertainty and updating prior probabilities, BNs can incorporate various sources of information, including expert judgment on the complex interactions of ecological, socioeconomic, cultural and political factors. BNs can produce probabilistic outcome projections for particular interventions and thereby supply decision-makers with robust science-based support for decisions. Here we use two case studies to show the use of BNs for agricultural development decisions. BNs were developed to describe the probable nutritional status of households over the course of a year under different agricultural development decisions with a focus on horticultural systems and botanical resources. The first study concerned Kenyan farming households and their decision to plant, or not to plant, fruit plants of Carica papaya L., Mangifera indica L., Passiflora edulis Sims. and Persea americana Mill. The second BN describes the impact pathway for transitioning from small-scale farming systems to industrial-scale agriculture proposed in Uganda’s National development plan. At the heart of the process is a participatory workshop, which is convened before any other analysis begins. Workshops sought to develop a decision-centered model based on the knowledge of a wide range of local experts. Participants were trained to estimate their own state of uncertainty and thereby reduce errors of judgment, under-confidence or overconfidence In order to facilitate the most accurate BN structures and variable estimates. Input variables were identified and their values quantified as probability distributions that describe participants’ current state of uncertainty. BNs show a high probability that the nutritional status of households will be positively impacted by planting fruit trees in Kenya and negatively through agricultural development in Uganda. This approach shows how using expert knowledge in participatory BNs can generate plausible household nutrition outcomes of agricultural development decisions. The methodology can be expanded to inform more of these difficult decisions.},

All identiﬁable causal eﬀects can be derived using the rules of do-calculus, but the rules themselves do not give any direct indication whether the eﬀect in question is identiﬁable or not. Shpitser and Pearl (2006b) constructed an algorithm for identifying joint interventional distributions in causal models, which contain unobserved variables and induce directed acyclic graphs. This algorithm can be seen as a repeated application of the rules of do-calculus and known properties of probabilities, and it ultimately either derives an expression for the causal distribution, or fails to identify the eﬀect, in which case the eﬀect is non-identiﬁable. In this paper, the R package causaleﬀect is presented, which provides an implementation of this algorithm. Functionality of causaleﬀect is also demonstrated through examples.},

	abstract = {In the course of an ethnopharmacological survey carried out among the Bedouins of the Negev desert, it was noticed that in addition to the use of modern medical services, medicinal plants were also being employed. We deemed it worthwhile, therefore, to investigate the current status of herbal medicine among the Negev Bedouins and to evaluate the relative efficiency of the plants used. To evaluate plant effectiveness by enquiries among patients once treated was found to be difficult and impractical. Hence, each interviewed informant was first requested to volunteer information on the plants and their uses. Next, to avoid the risk of memory failure, a list of 50 commonly used species was read out and the informant was asked to provide information on any that were familiar to him as medicinal herbs. Of 81 plant species mentioned by our 27 informants, 41 were named or recognized by more than 3. These species were arranged in accordance with the percentage of informants suggesting the same medicinal use for a given species as compared with the total number of informants reporting any sort of use for that plant. The obtained ratio was defined as the fidelity level (FL). The rank-order priority (ROP) of the plants was derived from these FL values. The relative popularity level (RPL) of the plants encountered was determined and plants were accordingly designated as "popular" or "unpopular". FL values were further adjusted, according to RPL value. We found that the bark of Phagnalon rupestre is widely used to induce deliberate burns for the healing of various ailments (ROP = 100), while infusion of the shoots of Teucrium polium, or of Artemisia herba-alba is employed to a lesser degree (ROP = 66 and 56, respectively) to relieve stomach disorders. Because the latter two species show fairly high ROP and are seen to be directly curative, they merit further investigation. Additional findings and implications of our ethnopharmacological survey are duly discussed.},
