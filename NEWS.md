# ethnobotanyR News

This version 0.1.9.1 of ethnobotanyR is a working version (thus the redundant trailing '.1':

Adding new vignettes for species names and for modeling
Starting the process of dismantling the quantitative indices stuff in favor of some modeling - adding more modeling and removing - or at least scaling back argumentation about - the quant. indices

# version 0.1.9 News

This version 0.1.9 of ethnobotanyR is a patch:

# Enhancements

Updated for R 4.2.0 "Vigorous Calisthenics":

- Added color options for `ethno_alluvial()` and `radial_Plot()` 
- Add error checks for use observations with more than count '1'
- Add corrections for those same use observations
- Added a new vignette `Modeling with ethnobotanyR` (split the existing into one about indices and one about modeling and expanded on both)
- Add more visual output options in `ggplot2` (...)
- Update the non-parametric bootstrap as a Bayesian Model `ethno_boot()`


# Bug fixes

- Removed pbapply options
- Address issues with the gap.degree in chord plots (add a warning that more than 50 species or informants is a lot)
- Remove arguments for dplyr (to work with version on the way)
- Address CRAN issue https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_isoband.html
