# ethnobotanyR News

ethnobotanyR 0.1.6 is a patch:

Updated UVs() following Tardio and Pardo-de-Santayana (2008)

simple_UVs() now calculates a simple UVs cf. Albuquerque et al. (2006).

Fidelity level per species FLs() from Friedman et al. (1986) is added.

Now includes the CVe() from Reyes-Garcia et al. (2006).

The ethnobotanyChord() function is now dissaggregated into ethnoChord() and ethnoChordUser() functions to allow for plotting simple circos plots of the uses and users per species. 

The CIs() function is updated to reflect the simpler URs/N calculation.
